            Photography has fallen to the wayside in the last few years. Instead of letting my camera collect dust for the next few years, I've been challenged to take one picture for 30 days. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn some website knowledge as well. (Thanks to <a href="http://stangles.me/">Steven</a> and Dani for inspiration!) So this is all one big experiment. Enjoy!
