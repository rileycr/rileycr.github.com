            Photography has fallen to the wayside in the last few years. Instead of letting my camera continue to collect dust for the <em>next</em> few years, I've been challenged to take one picture a day for 30 days. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn some website basics and web design. (Thanks to <a href="http://stangles.me/">Steven</a> and Dani for inspiration!) So this is all one big experiment. Enjoy!

                  I almost forgot to take my picture today, though it was a good opportuinty to get some low-light experience with my camera. I also spent way too much time trying to stack multiple shots together. This one's the result of a rather crude method, but I think it works.
