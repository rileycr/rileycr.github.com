            Photography has fallen to the wayside in the last few years. Instead of letting my camera continue to collect dust for the <em>next</em> few years, I've been challenged to take one picture a day for 30 days. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn some website basics and web design. (Thanks to <a href="http://stangles.me/">Steven</a> and Dani for inspiration!) So this is all one big experiment. Enjoy!

                  A little fiddling with the editor can really bring up the low light details. I like how you can see the night sky in the background now.

                  I had a tough time picking a photo for today. I like how this shot is a mixture of tree types with a subtle contrast between them. Kind of a picture that needs some time to pick out the details. The intended subject is the one with the legumes hanging from the branches.
