            Photography has fallen to the wayside in the last few years. Instead of letting my camera continue to collect dust for the <em>next</em> few years, I've been challenged to take one picture a day for 30 days. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn some website basics and web design. (Thanks to <a href="http://stangles.me/">Steven</a> and Dani for inspiration!) So this is all one big experiment. Enjoy!

                  Sneaking a peek at Wash U's construction site. I like the red stripes on the cement truck.

                  While walking through Tower Grove Park on the way to the library, I found a tree with this awesome lightning strike.
